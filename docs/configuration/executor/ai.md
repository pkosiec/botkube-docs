**This plugin is available as a part of the Botkube Cloud offering.**

Botkube is introducing new plugins with advanced functionality that will be part of the Botkube Team and Enterprise packages. These advanced plugins require cloud services provided by Botkube and are not part of the Botkube open source software.

As part of this change, some of the existing Botkube plugins are being moved to a new repository. This repository requires authentication with a Botkube account. To continue using these Botkube plugins, create an account at https://app.botkube.io/ and configure a Botkube instance, or [migrate an existing installation with the Botkube CLI](../../cli/migrate.md).

:::

The AI Assistant plugin makes it easier than ever for teams to identify, diagnose, and troubleshoot issues in any Kubernetes cluster. It is powered by the GPT-4o LLM model with additional Kubernetes-related capabilities.

## Enabling the plugin

You can enable the plugin as a part of Botkube instance configuration.

1. If you don't have an existing Botkube instance, create a new one, according to the [Installation](../../installation/index.mdx) docs.
2. From the [Botkube Cloud homepage](https://app.botkube.io), click on a card of a given Botkube instance.
3. Navigate to the platform tab which you want to configure.
4. Click **Add plugin** button.
5. Select the AI plugin.
6. Click **Save** button.

## Configuration

Currently, the AI plugin doesn't have any configuration options.
