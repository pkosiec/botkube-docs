## Usage

After downloading the CLI, you can start experimenting right away!

### Chat mode

To start a session in chat mode, simply run:

```shell
fuse
```

:::note
Native text selection is disabled in chat mode. To select text, please use the following workaround:

- **For Linux:** Press and hold `Shift` while selecting text.
- **For macOS:** Press and hold `Option` while selecting text.
  :::

### Inline prompting

:::tip
When using inline mode, enclose your prompt in single quotation marks (') to prevent your shell from interpreting it.
:::

Fuse CLI also supports inline mode, allowing you to execute prompts directly. Run:

```shell
fuse 'list files in the current directory and provide me better organization structure'
```
